# HN Clone

Use the stories inside `stories.json` to create a replica of the HN landing page.

Each story has:
- descendants: this is the comments count
- by: this is the username of the creator
- score: this are the "points" of the post
- title: title
- url: url to an external page, most of the times an article. Note
how HN only shows the hostname in the landing page.
