Then, there was an opening at the school I graduated from for an assistant instructor and I took it. I then went on to teach in courses such as 3d modelling, FEA and transducers and electrical prototyping. I have great fun with it and learn a tonne as well as I get to interact with lots of smart and ambitious students.<p>So why leave a job like that?<p>It&#x27;s mainly the pay but I also sort of fell in love with software this year. I started learning JavaScript last year, learned about databases, servers, React and Linux stuff. Loads of really exciting fun stuff!<p>So now I don&#x27;t know how to transition to a software role. Many places I apply to want people who have experience in software development or they want to hire a junior for some super low pay. \nI can&#x27;t put the words &quot;software developer&quot; on my resume but I have written a lot of programs for my classes and in hobby projects.<p>It feels like nobody looks at your GitHub profile though. I&#x27;ve got lots of projects I&#x27;ve done in the last year. But maybe that&#x27;s just the grind? Just need to apply to enough places?",

And since it hasn&#x27;t proven to be a problem yet there&#x27;s no need to find a business solution. When you try to market a solution for a non-existent problem, the result is novelty. Novelty may be profitable in the short term but usually is unsustainable. This leads to entrepreneurs misplacing their time and money. Examples of novelty can be seen in Tyler Cowen&#x27;s video on the Great Stagnation. The internet promotes more ideas than problems. And genuine problems are difficult to locate, understand or verify.<p>Solutions to problem 1:<p>- Create a submission process for filtering real problems from ideas.<p>- As part of the submission process, peer review submissions through industry experts.<p>- Submissions that fail peer review, will be tagged as &quot;ideas&quot; instead of &quot;problems&quot;.<p>- Index submissions into long form centralized discussions that are searchable by tags&#x2F;keywords.<p>- Promote objective discussions of submissions through citations of transparent data.<p>Problem 2: Entrepreneurs profit as a byproduct of rent seeking, financialization, offshoring, consolidation.<p>These business models generate profit from innovation that is not based on the classical definition of solving problems by improving everyone&#x27;s wellbeing.<p>Solutions to problem 2:<p>- Tag submissions by type of innovation.<p>- Incentivize submissions for classical innovation over rent seeking, financialization, offshoring, consolidation.<p>- Incentivize discussion for brainstorming publicly available business plans for verified problems.<p>Do any sites like this exist?",

We’ve been RepeaterStore since we first started the company back in 2007. The industry has moved to calling the devices well sell “boosters.&quot; And a big part of our business is now installing Distributed Antenna Systems in larger buildings.<p>I spoke it over with our team and got buy-in. I explained the risks as I understood them: from every piece of guidance I’d read, we&#x27;d expect a significant loss in traffic, but a relatively quick recovery over the course of 2-3 months.<p>We checked to make sure our new domain had a clean history. We set up 301 redirects from every URL on RepeaterStore to our new domain. Everything on our backend stayed the exact same, as did our overall URL structure. We ran crawl tests. We followed every piece of guidance that Google provides for moving domains, including submitting via their “Change of Address Tool.”<p>The loss in rankings happened immediately: the next day, we lost 65% of our referral traffic from Google.<p>We waited 90 days, expecting our traffic to begin to recover. But there wasn’t even the slightest bump.<p>We reached out to SEO consultants. Had we done something wrong? They found some minor issues, but nothing that wasn’t also an issue on our old site.<p>It’s now been 170 days. Our traffic remains 65% lower than before we changed our domain. Things may rebound at some point. But I can’t continue to wait for that to happen.<p>As time has gone on, I’ve learned that Google’s algorithm simply doesn’t &quot;understand&quot; when a company rebrands. Their \nChange of Address&quot; Tool is meant to help. But it’s far from being a panacea.<p>If you’re considering a rebrand and rely on traffic from Google: please heed this warning.

You can take complex numbers mod p as well, but for them, the little theorem fails.<p>More specifically, for p &gt; 2, if c = (a, b), then c^p = c mod p iff p is of the form p=4n+1.  If p=4n+3, then c^p = c conjugate mod p.  In this context, the conjugate of c is (a, p-b).<p>Why?  Because i^4n+1 = i, but i^4n+3 = -i.  The rest follows from the binomial proof of the little theorem (see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Proofs_of_Fermat%27s_little_theorem).",

Definitely the overall length of process, but also things like how many (if any): paid&#x2F;unpaid projects, coding &quot;challenges&quot; or &quot;take-homes&quot;, technical phone &#x2F; video screens, code reviews, portfolio reviews, whiteboarding sessions, pair programming sessions, etc are involved in the process.<p>Others have posted that things like salary ranges would be helpful.<p>Companies currently post a lot about their tech stack, personnel, and how much money they raised, which is nice for deciding if you want to apply with a company at all.<p>What other things would be helpful?  Looking forward to hearing your suggestions!",
